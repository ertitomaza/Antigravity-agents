# Project Guidelines & Rules

## Organization Rules
- **Encapsulation**: Every time a new feature, game, or complex tool is created, it **MUST** be placed in its own dedicated directory (e.g., `Desert Jumper Game/`).
- **Guidelines Location**: All project rules and guidelines **MUST** be stored in the `Project Guidelines & Rules/` folder.
- **No Root Pollution**: Avoid placing multiple project-specific files directly in the root directory or inside `.agent/` (unless they are global skills). 

## Technical Standards
- Follow the patterns defined in `.agent/skills/clean-code` and `.agent/skills/coding-standards`.
- Always use `index.html`, `style.css`, and `game.js` (or `main.js`) for web projects to maintain consistency.

## Git Workflow
- Commit messages should be descriptive.
- Special command: `comit push (mensaje)` for full repository synchronization.
