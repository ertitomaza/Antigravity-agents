# Mac Mini M4 Enclosure Project

## Technical Specification

Act as a professional Product Designer and Mechanical Engineer. Design a minimalist, two-part protective enclosure for the 2025 Mac Mini M4 (12.7cm footprint) stacked with a Minisopuro Hub base.

### Technical Specifications:

- **Geometry**: Follow the 'Squircle' industrial design of the Mac Mini M4. The enclosure must seamlessly wrap both devices with a precise friction fit and an interior offset for scratch protection.
- **Connectivity Layout**:
    - **Front**: Precision cutouts for the Mac Mini's dual USB-C ports and 3.5mm jack, plus the Hub's SD readers and front-facing I/O.
    - **Rear**: Unobstructed access for Power, Ethernet, HDMI, and the triple Thunderbolt array.
- **Thermal Management**: Implement CNC-style lateral ventilation grids (hexagonal or vertical slit patterns) on both side panels, ensuring high airflow without compromising structural integrity.
- **Material Aesthetic**: Simulate a matte anodized aluminum finish or a premium textured polymer.
- **Functional Features**: Include internal cable management channels between the Mini and the Hub, and non-slip TPU-style feet at the bottom.

### Output Requirement:
Provide 3 high-fidelity orthographic views (Front, Side, Rear) and 1 perspective rendering showing the thermal grid detail.
